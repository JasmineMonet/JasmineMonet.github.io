What I found from sorting Chicago Public Schools Progress Report Cards.
By: Jasmine M. Ellis
The Chicago Public School (CPS) system is currently in a crisis. Multiple outlets are reporting that Illinois still hasn't passed a state budget, which will affect students going to school this fall. In fact, a lot of the schools won't open because they will not have state funding. I think that in order to understand what's going on with CPS, aside from no state funding, we should look at progress reports from the past.
Let's take a look at CPS' Progress Report Cards from 2011-2012. The database, which is published on City of Chicago's Data Portal, gives information on the schools including CPS performance policy level and student attendance score. Before I go any further, I should explain what exactly the CPS performance policy entails. According to the 2010 CPS Performance Policy FAQ states, "The Performance, Remediation and Probation Policy is the Districtâ€™s school accountability policy. Its purpose is to
  effectively and fairly measure school performance, and to determine which schools, if any, need to be placed on
  academic probation." 
And the levels are as follows:
  -Level 1 (Excellent Standing): Elementary schools receiving at least 71% of available points and high schools receiving at least 66.7% of available points. 
  -Level 2 (Good Standing): Elementary schools receiving between 50-70.9% of available points and high schools receiving between 44% and 66.6% of available points.
  -Level 3 (Probation): Elementary schools receiving less than 50% of available points and high
schools receiving less than 44% of available points.
I sorted the information from A-Z and compared the two categories that I mentioned. Let's take the first school at the top of the spreadsheet and the last school at the bottom and compare the two.
Abraham Lincoln Elementary school had a level 1 CPS performance policy level and the average student attendance was at 96% in 2011-2012. William W Carter Elementary School is not the last school on the list but it's the final school to have a performance policy. In 2011-2012, the school had a level 3 policy performance level and average student attendance was at 91.20%.
When I originally took a look at the data set I thought that there would be a direct correlation between the CPS policy performance and average school attendance. However, that's clearly not the case at all with William W Carter Elementary School. I'm not exactly sure why the two categories aren't mutually exclusive. 
What is mutually exclusive is the instruction score vs. the environment score. Let's go back to our two schools:
  Abraham Lincoln Elementary School's instruction score was at 66% and the environment score was at 74% in 2011-2012. And William W Carter Elementary School's instuction score was at 35% and environment was at 33% in 2011-2012.

Overall, I think that it woudld be interesting to see if the information from this database points to some of the issues that are taking place in CPS now.
