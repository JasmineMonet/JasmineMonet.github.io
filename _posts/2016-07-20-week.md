This week, I decided to challenge myself in two subject areas that I stuggle with: languages and sports. Data visualization is something that I'm just now learning about so I thought it would be good to pick two examples that are slightly foreign to me. I selected "After Babylon: Analysis of the current lingusitic situation of the world" and "Most Valuable Sports Franchises."
