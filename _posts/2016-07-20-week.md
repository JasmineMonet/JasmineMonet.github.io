This week, I decided to challenge myself in two subject areas that I stuggle with: languages and sports. Data visualization is something that I'm just now learning about so I thought it would be good to pick two examples that are slightly foreign to me. I selected "After Babylon: Analysis of the current lingusitic situation of the world" and "Most Valuable Sports Franchises." After spending a significant amount of time with both data visualizations, I realized that one would be considered better than the other. Not to my surprise the languages one was easier to navigate than the sports one. No surprise there, I guess... since I strongly dislike sports. Here are my thoughts on both:

"After Babylon: Analysis of the current lingusitic situation of the world":
Created in 2013 by the Puff Puff Team (made up of five people) the database takes a look at the languages across the globe.

Last, but not least the database looks at the "loanword system," which is defined as "a word adopted from another language and completely or partially naturalized." There are 14.680 exchange words among languages says the database. 
After taking a critical look at this database there are many reasons why I think it's a good representation of data visulaization. One of these reasons being that it's user-friendly. While the
