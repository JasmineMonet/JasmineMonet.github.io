For this assignment, I decided to look at the <a href= "http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/lacrime.htm"> Louisiana Crime Rates from 1960-2014.</a> Originally, I wanted to look at a dataset for the state from the 2010-2014 but I wasn't able to find the r^2 value that was greater than 0.8. So I decided to look at the burglary data from 1990-1999. And it was successful.

After I put the information in a Google sheet, I was able to make a successful chart. I found that the r^2 equals 0.91, which means that you have a clear idea of what the trend was for burglary. From the chart, you can clearly see that the numbers involving burglary decrease over time. 

You can access the Google sheet here: <a href= "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cBpxsAambatf_aIX7_E4F8uY_kfGVJ9DF-NoFEGsPGU/edit#gid=0">Louisiana Crime Rates 1990-1999</a>

Next, I looked at the intercept, which is 69977.62242. And then finally, I decided to predict what crime would look like in 2005. My Google sheet predicted that burglary would be at 927.85 in 2005. However, when I compared it to the actual file with the crime rates the outcome was different. It turns out that the burglary was less at 873.7 in 2005. So that specific crime had actually decreased. So overall, that's a good thing. I decided to take this one step further and predict what 2016 will look like since that data isn't in the file. It predicted that in 2016 the burglary rate will be at 549.03 in Louisiana. It'll be interesting to see if that's true.
